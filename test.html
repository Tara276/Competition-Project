  <h1>Reasons to choose computing.</h1>

  <h3>(We've got alot)</h3>

  <p>Frist off, why <strong>NOT</strong>? You learn what happens and what to do when your laptop glitches,<em>and that switching it off and on repeatedly isnt the answer for everything</em>.</p>

  <p>Today, almost every person in every part of the world uses some form of a computer every day and having a general understanding of computers can not only help you function in today's world it can prevent you from getting left behind.</p>

  <li><h2>Learning about computers can help you find a job</h2></li>

  <p>Almost every job today and jobs of the future require some technical knowledge. Learning more about computers and computer software required for the job can a competitive edge against others who may be applying for the same job. Yes, even McDonald's.</p>

  <li><h2>Computers can save and make you money</h2></li>

  <p>A computer can also save you money, and there are dozens of places online that allow you to compare prices and shop. Someone with the right skills can quickly find the best price and even get the item shipped to them without even having to leave their house.<em> Which is personally the best part.</em></p>

  <p>Computers can also make you money by giving you the freedom of working for yourself by doing different things online.</p>

  <li><h2>You Can Create Anything You Want</h2></li>

  <p>At its core, computer programming gives you the ability to digitize your ideas. Imagine being able to actually implement any idea that you could think about! You know that idea you have for an awesome app that would go viral once it was released out into the wild… Yeah that one – you could actually create that yourself. Let’s face it, if you are like most people, you might not have a giant pile of cash stashed away to hire somebody to make that app for you because it can get very expensive, very quickly. On the other side let’s say you had some money put away in your account overseas in the Bahamas, it is very unlikely that the person you hire will implement your idea of the app exactly how you want.</p>

  <h2>Because Steve Jobs said so.</h2>

  <p>Steve Jobs once said, "Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer... because it teaches you how to think."</p>
